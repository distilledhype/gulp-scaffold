# gulp-scaffold

This is a Gulp setup that allows you to scaffold text files via the command line.

This is just the result of something I learned recently.

## How To Use

Clone this repo:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/distilledhype/gulp-scaffold
```

Then install all the dendencies with 

```js
npm install 
```

Now you can go ahead and scaffold a test file with

```sh
gulp --headline="My Headline" --text="My text" 
```
