# gulp-scaffolding

This is a Gulp setup that allows you to scaffold text files via the command line.

This is just the result of something I learned recently.

## How To Use

Check out this repo. 

```sh
git clone http://github.com/distilledhype/gulp-scaffolding
```

Then install all the dendencies with 

```js
npm install 
```

Now you can go ahead and scaffold a test file by typing

```sh
gulp --headline="My Headline" --text="My text" 
```

into the command line.
